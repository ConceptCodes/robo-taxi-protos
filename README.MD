# Robo Taxi Protocols

Effective communication between system components is essential for the Robo Taxi platform. To achieve this, we utilize [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) v3 as our Interface Definition Language (IDL). Protocol Buffers provide a language-neutral, platform-independent, and extensible framework for serializing structured data, ensuring efficient and reliable message exchange across our system.
